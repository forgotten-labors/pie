* auto-refresh browser in dev mode?
* add lookup to figure out which rules to trigger when a file changes (maybe pre-calc the tree that will be computed to avoid duplicates?) -> instead, maybe store a queue of current & pending operations & scan on job creation to avoid duplicates?
* do I need a reverse dependency map in order to specify granular build targets? is it a required feature?
* (advanced) store mapping file mtime, cache mappings and only recompute when needed? (this probably won't work due to anon fun serialization, and probably isn't needed anyhow)
