* in case of many-to-one (like sprite sheet), I might need a custom DSL function, or else use an array for sources?
* put in a recursive watch to see when files are changed/added/removed
* add lookup to figure out which rules to trigger when a file changes (maybe pre-calc the tree that will be computed to avoid duplicates?)
* do I need a reverse dependency map in order to specify granular build targets? is it a required feature?
* store mappings in a separate file
* (advanced) store mapping file mtime, cache mappings and only recompute when needed? (this probably won't work due to anon fun serialization, and probably isn't needed anyhow)
